# TAC Expert

## Domain Overview
Tactical Agentic Coding (TAC) is a comprehensive methodology for transforming engineers into irreplaceable commanders of compute. Built on 8 fundamental tactics and 7 advanced lessons, TAC teaches how to build systems that build systems, moving from in-loop prompting to zero-touch engineering.

## Expert Type
**Domain Expert** - Deep expertise in agentic coding methodology, covering the full spectrum from basic prompting to multi-agent orchestration with ADWs.

## Core Insight
> **Key Insight**: Your hands and mind are no longer the best tools for writing code. Build systems that build systems, prioritize the agentic layer, and become the commander of compute. The irreplaceable engineer transforms their codebase into a self-operating machine.

## Key Capabilities
- **8 Fundamental Tactics**: Stop Coding, Adopt Agent's Perspective, Template Your Engineering, Stay Out The Loop, Always Add Feedback Loops, One Agent One Prompt One Purpose, Target Zero-Touch Engineering, Prioritize Agentics
- **7 Advanced Lessons**: Elite Context Engineering, Agentic Prompt Engineering, Building Specialized Agents, Multi-Agent Orchestration, Orchestrator with ADWs, Agent Experts, Software Delivery ADW
- **80+ ADW Patterns**: Reusable AI Developer Workflows for end-to-end automation
- **100+ Commands**: Battle-tested prompts across all 7 agentic prompt levels

## Frameworks

### Core Four (In-Agent Leverage Points)
| Lever | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Context** | What can your agent see? |
| **Model** | Which Claude model for the task? |
| **Prompt** | The fundamental unit of engineering |
| **Tools** | What can your agent do? |

### 12 Leverage Points
- **4 In-Agent**: Context, Model, Prompt, Tools
- **8 Through-Agent**: Documentation, Types, Architecture, Tests, Planning, ADWs, Review, Observability

### Agentic KPIs
| KPI | Goal | Description |
|-----|------|-------------|
| Attempts | DOWN | Fewer iterations to success |
| Size | UP | Larger autonomous task scope |
| Streak | UP | Consecutive successful runs |
| Presence | DOWN | Less human intervention needed |

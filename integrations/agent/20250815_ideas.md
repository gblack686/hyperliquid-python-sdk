# Crypto Trading Confluence Indicators

## Volume Spikes on BTC and ETH
Monitor for sudden large increases in volume on Bitcoin and Ethereum. Used to anticipate volatility or institutional activity.

## Moving Average Crossovers (15-Minute Chart)
Track 50-period vs. 200-period SMA/EMA crossovers. Indicates momentum shifts and potential trend changes.

## Ichimoku Cloud (4-Hour Chart)
Entry signals: Price breaks through cloud with Lagging Span confirmation. Exit signals: Price returns into or below the cloud.

## Bollinger Band Squeeze and Expansion (15-Minute Chart)
Use to identify volatility contractions and breakout potentials.

## RSI on Multiple Timeframes
Compare 15m, 4H, and 1W RSI for overbought/oversold signals across trends.

## Open Interest and Liquidity Levels on Hyperliquid
Track spikes in open interest and changes in liquidity zones. Helps detect crowding and risk of liquidation events.

## Grid Trading Setup
Create layered limit orders in price ranges to capitalize on sideways markets. Acts as both a passive strategy and liquidity test.

## MACD Crossovers (4-Hour Chart)
Use MACD line and Signal line crossovers to confirm directional moves.

## Stochastic Oscillator (15-Minute Chart)
Use for short-term momentum confirmation when entering or exiting trades.

## Support and Resistance Levels
Track key previous highs/lows on 4H and Weekly. Mark levels for entries, exits, and SL/TP zones.

## Fibonacci Retracement Levels
Plot from swing high to swing low on 4H. Identify clusters with S/R or MA crossovers.

## ATR (Average True Range)
Measure volatility to size positions and time entries. ATR spikes = High volatility environment.

## Indicator Divergence
Look for price divergence with MACD or RSI. Bullish divergence = Price makes lower low, RSI makes higher low.

# Hyperliquid & HypurrScan Overview

## Hyperliquid — L1 or L2?
- **Type**: Layer-1 (L1) blockchain
- **Reason**: Built from the ground up as an independent network with its own validator set and consensus mechanism (HyperBFT)
- **Key Features**:
  - Native on-chain perpetual and spot order books
  - Sub-second finality
  - Integrated HyperEVM runtime for smart contracts, secured by the same L1 consensus
  - Purpose-built for high-performance trading
- **Why not L2?**: Does not rely on Ethereum or another chain for security or settlement

## Stop-Limit Orders & Large Quantities
- **Not guaranteed**: Even if your stop triggers, you may get partial or no fill
- **Reasons**:
  - Insufficient liquidity at your limit price
  - Price gaps past your limit before fill
  - Queue position behind earlier orders
- **Best Practices**:
  - Use stop-market for fill certainty (less price control)
  - Layer orders at different stop/limit combinations to increase fill probability and control slippage

### Layering Example (Sell 1,000 contracts)
- Stop $100.10 / Limit $100.00 — 300 contracts
- Stop $100.00 / Limit $99.90 — 400 contracts
- Stop $99.90 / Limit $99.80 — 300 contracts

## Liquidity Charts for HYPE
- Best viewed directly in Hyperliquid's native UI: full real-time order book and depth view
- Aggregators (CoinGecko, CMC) show price and +/− 2% depth but no full DOM heatmap
- No public, widely-used third-party depth chart tools exist

## HypurrScan — Dashboard Tools
HypurrScan is a Hyperliquid-specific block explorer with enhanced analytics.

### Features
1. **Dashboard** — live auctions, TWAP orders, recent transfers
2. **Token Pages** — supply, market cap, distribution history
3. **Address Tracking** — transactions, holdings, positions
4. **Ecosystem Stats** — HIP-2 USDC TVL, spot TVL, fees, sentiment index
5. **Staking Tools** — delegate/unstake HLP, APR comparison, reward tracking

### Use Cases
- Whale tracking & auction monitoring
- Token health analysis
- Staking performance monitoring

## HYPE Current Price
| Platform      | Price (USD) | 24h Change |

| Kraken        | ~$48.43     | +9.97%     |

### Entry Timing
- **2026-02-03 XRP**: Entered when price extended to lower Bollinger Band (16.5%). Trade worked but entry could have been 1-2% better with patience.

### Rules Developed
1. **Bollinger Extension Filter**: Avoid entries within 1% of upper/lower band
2. **Chase Less, Wait More**: Conviction on direction doesn't require immediate entry
